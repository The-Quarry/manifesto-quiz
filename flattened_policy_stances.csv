Sue Aldwell,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"Investing in Affordable Housing, both for renting and buying is on everyone’s agenda.

Sue Aldwell,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,"If we want business to invest in our Island, we must skill and upskill our workforce to build our economy for Guernsey to prosper.

Art Allen,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",1,"Ever since our Politicians took a sledgehammer to education by axing the 11 plus in favour of a 2 tier system of Education, we have all witnessed continuing frustrating banter which may not fulfil the need for children to develop their capabilities and give them equitable opportunities in life until I/we speak up for common sense and equity."
Art Allen,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",-1,(Standing against any form of Goods and Services Tax G.S.T. will also be my focus).

Art Allen,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,Guernsey and the Bailiwick Islands must urgently diversify from the current narrow bands of income.

Yvonne Burford,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"Housing and population go hand in hand. Recent relaxations in population policy have made it even harder for local residents, especially young people, to afford homes - whether buying or renting. We need much smarter population policies that balance the needs of islanders with welcoming truly essential workers who we can’t recruit locally. If we don’t manage this situation, we risk a permanent housing crisis and people feeling forced to leave."
Yvonne Burford,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,"As a deputy, I have made progress by advocating for a greater move towards preventative care, by investment in early intervention and health improvement. The evidence is clear: without this we risk the level of healthcare we currently enjoy, which represents nearly 40% of the States budget, becoming simply unaffordable. If elected I will keep pressing for meaningful progress in this area for both physical and mental health issues."
Yvonne Burford,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",1,"Education was the top issue in 2020 with the Pause and Review, but after the election the review was dropped, and a majority of the States approved an expensive four-building model. Four years on, this has resulted in our Sixth Form students being housed indefinitely at La Mare from this September. I didn’t vote for this, but I don’t think we should make further big changes now - our children and teachers have had enough disruption."
Yvonne Burford,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"A thriving economy is vital. Making efficiencies and savings in our public sector should be a continual process, including listening to frontline staff - they often know best where savings and improvements can be made. Even with savings, we’ll still need to raise money for healthcare, infrastructure investment, and rebuilding our rainy-day fund, which are the three things driving the deficit. My voting record shows that I always support those who are less well-off. There’ll be lots of tax ideas at this election, some better thought through than others, but my promise to you is simple: I’ll only back fair tax changes that protect or improve things for low and middle earners, who are already under pressure."
Yvonne Burford,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,"A thriving economy is vital.

Yvonne Burford,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",2,"Guernsey’s charities and volunteers are the heartbeat of our island, tirelessly and selflessly supporting everything from youth programmes to elderly care, as well as our amazing environment. They strengthen our community and fill vital gaps with practical help, solutions and compassion. The States has an important role to play in supporting them and the work they do, particularly by committing to multi-year contracts that allow charities to plan ahead."
Yvonne Burford,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",2,"I believe in a government that is transparent, responsive, and focused on working for you. If what I stand for resonates, I’d be truly grateful for one of your 38 votes. Let’s work together to make Guernsey the best it can be – for everyone!"
Yvonne Burford,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",2,"As a past president of La Société Guernesiaise, I keenly understand the importance of protecting our natural environment. In an earlier term, I successfully steered the Biodiversity Strategy through the States. I will continue to prioritise brown field development to protect our green and open spaces."
Tina Bury,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",1,"There’s no quick fix to the housing crisis — if there were, it would have been done by now. But progress is possible with stronger collaboration. A huge amount of groundwork has gone into the Guernsey Housing Plan. It’s a vital foundation — and to make it work, we need closer communication between government and industry."
Tina Bury,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,"At the start of this term, I pushed for mental health to be taken seriously. It wasn’t flashy or headline-grabbing — just steady, persistent pressure until a review was finally launched. Too many people were falling through the cracks. When mental health is overlooked, people suffer, and we owe it to them to do better."
Tina Bury,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",1,"I brought an amendment calling for the proper comparison of secondary school models to be done - so decisions could be based on evidence, not assumptions. Big decisions about education need transparency, without open scrutiny we risk eroding trust."
Tina Bury,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"The weight of funding essential services can’t keep falling on the same shoulders. I support practical, fair tax solutions, that may mean GST, but first I want to see corporate tax reform and the closure of income tax loopholes. Everyone should contribute their fair share."
Tina Bury,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",0,No specific stance on economy and business was found in the candidate's text.
Tina Bury,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",1,"I speak up for people who often get overlooked, especially those struggling to be heard.

Tina Bury,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",2,"Right now, young people are paying into a system that may not be there for them. That’s not fair, and it’s not sustainable. We need an honest, grown-up conversation about how we fund long term care across generations."
Tina Bury,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"When I saw how much some candidates were spending just to get elected, I knew it wasn’t right, I challenged it. If standing for election costs thousands, only the wealthy can afford to run. That excludes people from all backgrounds representing their communities, and that’s not democracy."
Tina Bury,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",0,No specific stance on environment and sustainability was found in the candidate's text.
Andy Cameron,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"Housing will be our top priority next term. To meet demand, we must embrace modern methods of construction... Once we clear the bottleneck, it’s essential that we deliver the affordable housing we already know is urgently needed.

This isn’t just about childcare—it’s about educational quality, social equity, and economic resilience."

Andy Cameron,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",1,"Doubling the free Early Years Education entitlement from 15 to 30 hours... allows parents to move from part-time roles into more secure, long-term employment if they choose to, helping to reduce underemployment and narrow the gender pay gap."
Andy Cameron,Transport & Connectivity,"Supports improving transport links — including air/sea travel affordability, reliability, and access.",1,Improve air and sea links
Andy Cameron,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",1,Increase sheltered housing so older islanders can live independently for longer

Andy Cameron,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",2,Fast-track renewable energy
Haley Camp,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,Tackle the housing crisis. Everyone deserves a place to call home—at every stage of life. Link migration with housing: every government-driven job increase must come with a housing plan. Support private sector building: work with the industry to remove barriers to supply. Put islanders first: housing security must be a priority at every level of planning.
Haley Camp,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",0,No specific stance on healthcare was mentioned in the candidate's text.
Haley Camp,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,"Raise education standards. Excellence must be something we deliver—not just promise. Stop the political squabbling: focus on student outcomes, not buildings. Cut the bureaucracy: give schools real autonomy and focus more budget at the coalface and away from the education department's control. Look outward: adopt the best of local and global education models. Connect education to careers: build pathways into real jobs through industry-led collaborations."
Haley Camp,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,My priority is to grow our economy so we can fund what Guernsey needs — without digging deeper into your pockets. Manage government spend: drive a commercial mindset and smarter financial planning.
Haley Camp,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",2,"Grow the economy. A stagnating economy and too much talk about tax, not growth, means that real action is needed in this next term: Embrace technology: plan now for AI, better energy infrastructure and true digital capacity. Reclaim our entrepreneurial spirit: create a clear message that Guernsey is open for business. Embrace our finance industry: we must be a final destination for business again—not a last resort. Regulate, don’t dominate: actively rebalance in favour of growth and commercial innovation."

Tim Carre,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"I’m 100% confident I can fix the housing crisis in one year if the States of Guernsey relaxes one simple seemingly out of date regulation. As a Designer — Builder and ‘problem solver’, I see the answers to the housing crisis as a problem easy fixed. I have a 4-part strategy and one part of this strategy will begin easing this problem within 6 months."

Tim Carre,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",-1,"When it comes to children and education, I firmly believe there is no place for the distraction of gender ideology entering our schools. Children attend school to learn to read, write, learn mathematics and so much more. It is a sensitive, precious time in a child’s life, a child’s education must not be confused."
Tim Carre,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",-2,"No Unfair Tax Increases: - GST must remain the decision of the island and not the Deputies. Good and wise Deputies will negotiate hard on behalf of the ‘Low Income’ and the ‘Elderly’ to compensate them 100%. There must never be a direct tax increase on essentials such as supermarket food, petrol, heating, rent and electricity here in Guernsey."
Tim Carre,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,One of my suggestions is to restore a strong local horticulture industry to the island with the serious consideration of bringing back a modern ‘Guernsey Market’.

As a Deputy I will continually address this issue of elderly care.
Tim Carre,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,We must vote for Deputies with “Vision”. Deputies determined to build a future for Guernsey. Deputies who will “Solve Problems” and not get in the way.

FREE Sports facilities for youth FREE New Mountain Bike Park FREE Fishing clubs to train youth Life Saving Club
Garry Collins,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"We have a housing crisis, in my view created mainly by the States 2016 GP11 policy. We need to support not only the first-time buyers, but renters, pensioners trying to downsize and growing families. The States should be supporting Leales Yard not withdrawing. The Bridge area needs investment and support now."
Garry Collins,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,"The lack of funding is challenging our health committee. The States however shouldn’t be increasing waiting times, pensioners deserve better. We must also increase our mental health services; Islanders across all ages need our help now."

GST will hurt the poorest and most vulnerable in our community. I support changes in corporate tax, Pillar Il might eliminate the deficit. With high cost of living now, why introduce GST in the middle of a housing crisis?"
Garry Collins,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,"I support the G8 businesses views, with action on housing, better connectivity, education/skills and use of technology.

Tony Corbin,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",-1,I do not support the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax. GST is an unfair and destabilising tax. Guernsey needs its own solutions. Our island is secure and stable - we must protect that by finding fairer ways to balance our books without overburdening our families or the younger generation.

Rob Curgenven,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"Fast track plans to build upwards in select areas. With smart design we can build thousands of new homes, and free up green space, by building upwards in small pockets of St Peter Port. Introduce an ‘Essential Worker’ housing market with capped rents and secure tenure for key workers in health, education and emergency services. Apply an escalating surcharge on properties left empty for more than 12 months to bring housing back into use."

GST, for example, doesn’t fix the problem. It won’t provide enough funds to fill the ever-growing financial void. Instead, we will close the fiscal gap through growth, fairness and efficiency."

Rob Curgenven,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",2,"Introduce a freedom of information law with teeth. This is vital for allowing the public to keep the States in check. Pass a Whistleblower Protection Ordinance. Too often hard-working public servants witness serious wrongdoing but are scared to speak out. If we are to reform the civil service, it is vital that staff are free to talk about what is going wrong."
Rob Curgenven,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",1,Continue on with the wind farm project. Leasing just 6 % of our territorial waters for an offshore‐wind concession returns around £40 million a year.
David De Lisle,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,The shortage of housing must be overcome with programmes to encourage families onto the housing ladder. We must build affordable homes for local families and key workers through both public led schemes and private sector developments.
David De Lisle,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,"Health and Social Care must focus on preventative health care to reduce the risk of premature mortality. We must provide more skilled physicians, new operating theatres and modern diagnostic equipment to reduce costly interventions, and long waiting lists."
David De Lisle,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,"Education must be inclusive, equitable and promote opportunities for lifelong learning and provide the training to meet growing demands."
David De Lisle,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",-2,I will continue to oppose the introduction of GST. This tax will take two to three years to recover the cost of implementation both in staffing and equipment. It will add a cumbersome burden to everyone on the island already fighting the high cost of living.
David De Lisle,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,Growing and diversifying our economic base is key to increasing tax revenues and reducing the need for new taxes. We need to promote island renewable energy and new initiatives in the finance industry.
David De Lisle,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",1,There is urgent need for newer initiatives to encourage local participation in work. The connection with regional universities and further education facilities provides opportunities to many in the community to extend their horizons and skill sets.
David De Lisle,Transport & Connectivity,"Supports improving transport links — including air/sea travel affordability, reliability, and access.",1,"Reliable, sustainable and affordable air and sea links are key to freedom to travel as well as capturing long and short stay holidays to our islands and to sustain our economy."
David De Lisle,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",1,The next term of government must reform long term care and provide more choice and assistance to the elderly to remain in their homes.
David De Lisle,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"I will continue to speak out for open, honest, transparent and accountable government for all islanders and voice public concerns."
David De Lisle,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",2,Having campaigned for higher environmental standards since entering the States much remains to be done. Our environment is precious to our health and well-being. Contamination from firefighting foam (PFOS) and glyphosate in our drinking water still needs to be resolved.
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"Deliver more affordable homes and unlock stalled developments. Support the rental market and strengthen protection for landlords and tenants. Support first-time buyers, downsizers and key workers. Guernsey’s housing crisis has been driven by rising costs and rapid population growth. I led the development of the Guernsey Housing Plan – a strategy created with industry that’s already delivering, with around 450 new affordable homes in the pipeline."
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,"Invest more in prevention and make healthy lifestyles easier. Support carers and stabilise care provision. Improve access to mental health and community-based services. Staying healthy for longer improves quality of life and reduces long-term costs. We know this approach works for us: initiatives like School Streets, Be Active, and Eat Well are already helping Guernsey positively buck the trend in childhood weight. I’d like to expand social prescribing and other effective, community-based approaches to make it easier for people to live well and stay healthy."
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,"Improve educational opportunities and outcomes, with greater efficiency. Strengthen Early Years and ALN provision. Expand vocational, digital and lifelong learning. I’m ambitious for education at every level. As a parent of four children in state schools, I know only too well how political decisions have impacted students and teachers, and I have challenged those that have led to the bigger class sizes and reduced curriculum choice that we’re seeing now."
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"Make our tax system fairer and more efficient. Protect essential services while investing wisely. Promote innovation and productivity. We are in an era of global economic uncertainty, and Guernsey is under real fiscal pressure thanks to our growing dependency ratio and imbalanced tax base. We must fund key services like housing, health and education, but do so responsibly, recognising the strain already on working people, pensioners and businesses."
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,"To keep our community strong, Guernsey must become more affordable and aspirational for younger generations whilst recognising the valuable role of older people, or we risk hollowing out our economy. I’ll continue advocating for strategic, evidence-based decisions that prioritise long-term sustainability, innovation, and economic productivity."
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",1,"We also need more focus on skilled trades, apprenticeships, digital education, and policies that support our hardworking teachers to thrive."

Lindsay de Sausmarez,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"I believe that good policy comes from bringing people together, listening to a range of views, and making evidence-based decisions with the long term in mind."
Lindsay de Sausmarez,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",2,"Protect Guernsey’s natural environment and biodiversity. Support fairness, inclusion and strong communities. Embed sustainability across government decisions. Sustainability makes sound economic sense, and it also means future generations can prosper. That means thinking long term, adapting to the changing climate, harnessing clean energy, reducing waste and pollution, safeguarding nature and access to green spaces, and building policies that are both socially and environmentally responsible."
Adrian Dilcock,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,The cost of housing here is generally unaffordable. Actual progress must be made during this next term. There are many levers which could be explored – rent control for example which might initially see a contraction of the rental market but could also drive down the cost of and increase the supply of homes for purchase.
Adrian Dilcock,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,We do have excellent healthcare services. One major difficulty is affordability on an individual basis. There are many islanders who through no fault of their own find themselves unable to access primary healthcare or fall off society’s financial cliff edge often in old age. This can have catastrophic results for the physical and mental health of the individuals concerned going forward. Your wealth should not determine your health.
Adrian Dilcock,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,I believe that every island child has the right to a high quality standard of education regardless of ability to pay. If improvements are required in the State sector they must be driven forward in the next political term. Our young people represent the island’s future. We cannot afford to let them down.
Adrian Dilcock,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",-1,Food and medical bills should definitely be exempt from any increase in indirect taxation. This is a reality. We have been eating into our financial reserves steadily for years. The next States must resolve this once and for all.
Adrian Dilcock,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",0,"It is self-evident that huge numbers of islanders are struggling to make ends meet, house themselves, keep themselves warm in winter, feed and clothe themselves or even remain in the island. The day to day problems that haunt islanders of all ages are inter-related and need to be viewed holistically. They ultimately make the island an uncompetitive jurisdiction and if unchecked will destroy the local economy as well as placing intolerable strains upon individuals and families."
Adrian Dilcock,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",0,No specific stance or quote related to employment & skills found in the text.
Adrian Dilcock,Transport & Connectivity,"Supports improving transport links — including air/sea travel affordability, reliability, and access.",-1,Since 2020 our position has worsened. Effectively we now have one (States owned) airline which lost around £100million in public ownership prior to 2020 plus massive one-off losses during the pandemic. The airline continues to lose money on a grand scale. It also has a recent history of unreliability and is very expensive to fly with.
Adrian Dilcock,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",2,Guernsey relies heavily on charitable organizations for many of our vital services. Both morally and financially the States needs to nurture the third sector. States of Guernsey contributions over the last ten years have remained static at around £5million per annum. There is an urgent need for the new States to review and increase the real term value of the States contribution to put Third Sector organisations on a stable footing going forward.
Adrian Dilcock,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,It is clear that there continues to be general public dissatisfaction with the way that States members interact with and listen to the public between elections. Government should be there to govern however it should also listen to the electorate other than for a few weeks prior to each election. I would support the introduction of a petition law as in Jersey and the UK.
Adrian Dilcock,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",1,"It is self evident that sea levels and the temperature of the planet are rising. It is also clear that whatever we do here on the island will have a miniscule effect worldwide on either of these issues. That’s definitely not to say we should as a community do nothing, but as an island which has significant densely populated low lying areas, including large areas below sea level, we must spend adequate amounts on coastal defences."
David Dorrity,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"The States needs to work quickly with developers to provide affordable housing for our lower earners and young people, or risk seeing them move away. Work must begin swiftly on the Bridge flood defences to enable progress with Leale’s Yard and GHA sites in the area, as failure to build has had a negative impact on the market and helped create the high rate of inflation that affects the rents and mortgage rates we pay."
David Dorrity,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",1,"We have a good healthcare system with excellent treatment available for all at the PEH, but I believe that we need to better fund primary care to better assist those who struggle to afford healthcare. The £12 grant for GP visits needs to be increased to help islanders seek early diagnosis."
David Dorrity,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",1,Our children are the Island’s future and need to be given every encouragement to embrace post-high school education - be that through A levels at the Sixth Form Centre or much needed skills for local industry through vocational studies and apprenticeships at The Guernsey Institute/College of Further Education.
David Dorrity,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"After closely studying the competing proposals, GST-plus seems to be the fairest way that has been suggested to strengthen the island’s future financial position — providing as it does protections for pensioners and lower earners."
David Dorrity,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,Guernsey is struggling with a high cost-of-living and inflation and hampered in its ability to complete vital projects due to financial pressures. To grow our way out of this situation we must optimise provision of support to business so that we are doing everything within our power to attract -and retain- employers who will help us achieve the economic stability we so badly need.
David Dorrity,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",0,No specific stance or quote found in the text provided.
David Dorrity,Transport & Connectivity,"Supports improving transport links — including air/sea travel affordability, reliability, and access.",-1,"Guernsey’s connectivity is crucial to islanders, and also to our ability to remain relevant in the business world. The Condor/Brittany Ferries agreement was not without its challenges, but has already boosted our tourism industry with increased visitor numbers. Aurigny staff are hard-working and dedicated, but issues outside of their control have contrived to make the airline expensive and unreliable since the decision to take it under States ownership."
David Dorrity,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",1,"Having lived with my parents on a housing estate, States and social housing and our communal support systems are of great importance to me. There was a lot less money to go around on the island back in the 70s when I was growing up, and I would hardly describe our estate as comfortable, but it served its purpose and was the safety net my family needed during those hard times."
David Dorrity,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"Guernsey must modernise our civil service structures to improve their efficiency, and also review the Island’s appetite to risk to show companies looking to operate here that Guernsey has a dynamic approach to business."
David Dorrity,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",1,"With our abundant natural resources and the largest tidal flows in Europe, Guernsey is perfectly placed to become a world-leading example of how to generate clean, low-cost electricity. I would like to see the island work with specialists in the fields of renewable energies with a view to achieving energy self-sufficiency."
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,The Housing crisis has not been treated as a crisis and it is critical that islanders can afford to live on Guernsey. I support: the creation of the new dedicated Housing Committee to completely focus and sustain efforts to develop the right amount of mixed housing for the island; the Guernsey Housing Association shared ownership scheme and the release of appropriate States owned land; first time buyer’s entry to the housing market and review of TRP to provide protection for first time buyer new builds for lower/middle income earners seeking to purchase their first property.
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,Health care is about treating the body and the mind and ensuring our social and physical well being. I support: sustained focus on public health education encouraging healthy lifestyles and promoting social prescribing and the value of physical activity; better access to help and care for those suffering from addiction and mental health issues; our health care workers and place great value on their role in the provision of a health care system that balances prevention and treatment with individual responsibility for good health.
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,"Taking Guernsey’s education from objectively good to excellent requires leaders who are both aspirational and inspirational, along with sustained investment. I have worked tirelessly to enhance the quality of our States education and will carry on doing so if re-elected. Investing in our young people through education produces the greatest returns for our island, offering them the prospect of higher wages, greater self-reliance, and reduced healthcare and criminal justice costs."
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"Balancing a tax regime which is competitive for business, fair to the community but provides enough money to fund and replenish essential public services is challenging. No one wants to raise taxes, but our current financial situation needs to change. Without action we will not have the money we need to fund future services such as a care model for our older community members and capital projects such as land for housing. I believe: in a fair, resilient tax system, which can pay for the services we rely on and which will also rebuild our the Capital Reserve so that we can invest in Guernsey’s future infrastructure; a cautious approach to debt is wise, ensuring that terms are transparent, with published spending plans and regular updates on payback and return on invested loan capital; there should be no increases in income tax for lower/ medium income earners; in reform for a fairer Social Security system; in greater support and flexibility for families to help with young children."
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",2,"Businesses of all sizes and sectors contribute to our economy. To achieve sustained economic growth, businesses need support to trade in a healthy environment with the right legal frameworks, the best knowledge and skills and up to date infrastructure. I believe: in continued focus on the diversification of the economy, e.g. higher education opportunities can also attract international students, renewed focus on agriculture and local food production and marine environment research, in support for entrepreneurs and small businesses, creating a vibrant environment for all sizes of company with sustained growth and attractive employee environment; in continuously seeking reduction of red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy; in investment in island attractions and flexibility around tourism accommodation; Investing in and maintaining resilient Sea and Air links."
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Employment & Skills,"Supports improving workforce readiness through skills training, job creation, or workforce support programmes.",2,"Taking Guernsey’s education from objectively good to excellent requires leaders who are both aspirational and inspirational, along with sustained investment.

Andrea Dudley-Owen,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"I have demonstrated my competence and capability as a representative for our island. I listen to and lead on what our community believes to be important. My personal qualities: Vision - I have a clear view of where to go and how to get there. Integrity - I am honest, committed and want to be accountable for my decisions. Resilience - I recover quickly from setbacks, moving forward, adapting to the situation. Collaborative - I take a balanced approach and work with others. Empathy - I seek out and understand different opinions, which helps inform my views. Humility - I am aware of my weaknesses and strengths, always seeking to improve."
Andrea Dudley-Owen,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",1,The States must take more decisive action to ensure that we reduce damage to our natural environment. I believe: energy infrastructure should support community; businesses and householder initiatives to invest in cleaner and more sustainable energy sources; more action is needed to reduce plastics and other pollutants in our island; in a continued focus on traffic management and enhanced public transport.
Simon Fairclough,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",-1,"One thing that I know that is happening right now, probably as we speak, is that the states are doing something which should have been done much earlier in the term, which is working with developers and builders to understand the obstacles that need to be overcome to convert those sites into housing and getting housing built."
Simon Fairclough,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",-1,"I think that, yes, we have done something, people are being expected to pay more. But the fact is, with the aging demographics, we are going to have to do something more substantial. It isn't going to be popular, but it's something that needs do, needs doing, and I think we need to be braver as an assembly."
Simon Fairclough,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",0,Education was one of the big issues last time around.

Compromise. Instead, we ended up with an unfunded budget for 2025. A situation that must be addressed immediately."
Simon Fairclough,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,"We must prioritise the island’s economy and housing needs.

Simon Fairclough,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"We need a fresh approach to politics.

Simon Fairclough,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",2,"As an active Member of the Committee for Environment & Infrastructure I have helped secure the future for the island’s dairy and quarrying industries.

Thus securing a brighter and greener future for us all."
Steve Falla,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"A scheme that will allow people to obtain their own affordable homes, be they modular, self-build or renovations. A reset of restrictive rules, even for a limited period, in respect of housing."
Steve Falla,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",1,Health and care needs a smarter approach including a reinvigorated conversation about partnership with Jersey.

Whether or not that resolution of the States survives, there is a need for broader tax reform where we are not just increasing the burden on individual Guernsey residents over and again."
Steve Falla,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",2,We must strive for economic growth by encouraging and supporting business.

To value and maintain the environment and green spaces for the enjoyment and wellbeing of all.
Peter Ferbrache,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"We need to provide people with hope and that starts with housing. There is no easy or quick solution, but we can do things now that will help. We can de-list the Heritage listing in respect of the Castel Hospital and release that for homes. We should purchase sites such as Leale’s Yard if available, put in the required infrastructure, and make it available for local residents to develop their own homes. We should come up with a structure to facilitate affordable loans to young prospective local home owners. We should relax and simplify yet further our planning laws."
Peter Ferbrache,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",1,We need to find a way of funding our long-term health and care needs. We may well need to consider certain types of compulsory insurance.

When we were considering tax reform we wanted to put a tax on the imports via UK and other providers. We were advised we could not do that without a consumption tax of our own. So if one is introduced we could help retailers, if they are operating fully retail premises, by giving them some relief against T.R.P."

Christopher Le Tissier,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",-1,"Health costs are rising. PEH Phase 2 went significantly over budget, in part due to information being withheld by civil servants. This must not be allowed to happen again.

The OECD's upcoming Pillar 2 rules will require a 15% minimum tax on large multinationals - expected to raise up to £40 million annually. In addition, we must close longstanding loopholes that allow many individuals to avoid paying tax, through personal investment companies.

Mary Lowe,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",1,"Educational outcomes must be a priority before buildings, our education system needs to excel and receive the necessary resources to do so.

The PACKAGE, which includes changes to social security and tax allowance will benefit low and middle income earners. Seven out of 10 households will be better off."
Mary Lowe,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",1,The difficulties travelling to the island with unreliable transport connectivity hasn’t helped our economy. The States need to recognise the airport & harbour are our gateways to the island and benefits the economy. If it means subsidising or reducing fees this should take place.

Mary Lowe,Social Care & Community Wellbeing,"Supports investment in services that protect vulnerable people — including care for the elderly, social housing, community outreach, and wellbeing programmes.",1,"The message the island needs to address the ‘ageing demographic’ problem sends out an unfortunate message to those who worked hard making this island successful. They should not be seen as a problem. There will unarguably be a cost as there are more older people relative to younger workers. But many older people are very active helping parents by looking after grandchildren, older relatives or friends and providing invaluable help with voluntary community services."
Mary Lowe,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"Form an independent SCRUTINY & PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE, not including politicians.

Paul Luxon,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",-2,Guernsey currently suffers from deficit of housing stock across all sectors.

Paul Luxon,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",2,No government can independently make an economy work.

Paul Montague,Healthcare,"Supports increased funding, staffing, or reform of the healthcare system, including mental health services and primary care.",2,"Everyday we see how mental health challenges affect young people. If students cannot attend school, their prospects shrink. But we must distinguish between diagnosable mental illness and the normal challenges of growing up. Support should be practical and help people return to education, work and life. Guernsey is rightly proud of its hard-working healthcare staff. However, we must not be complacent; we must support our Health and Social Care services to plan for our changing demographic profile in the coming years."
Paul Montague,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",2,Excellent education is a moral and economic necessity. People are our greatest resource and we must help to unlock everyone’s potential. The secondary sector has undergone major change; now we must support our schools to foster ambition and raise aspirations. Disruption caused by poor behaviour should not hold anyone back. We need to attract and retain committed teachers by making their work more rewarding and sustainable.
Paul Montague,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"To ensure long-term prosperity, we need honest dialogue about public finances. Spending cuts alone will not solve our problems. I support diversifying our tax base and do not favour relying entirely on income tax increases. The current GST+ proposal raises valid concerns, even though it does include measures to protect lower earners. However, it cannot be implemented unless it has wider public support. It must be clearly explained and be part of a broader, fairer tax strategy."

Tom Moore,Taxation & Public Finance,"Supports reforms to the tax system — including introducing new taxes (e.g. GST), changing income or company tax rates, or broadening the tax base to fund public services.",1,"We will run out of reserves by 2032 (according to data provided by public servants) unless we broaden our tax base or cut public spending and/or raise existing taxes to uncomfortable, self-defeating levels. The GST+ package isn’t meant to make life harder for ordinary people but though grounded in research, the outcomes remain projections, not guarantees. I do believe we need to restructure our tax in such a way that is fair and doesn’t risk driving out the most mobile contributors to our tax base."
Tom Moore,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",2,"I believe we need to diversify our industry, produce and export our own energy, offer interest-free loans to households seeking greater self-sufficiency and lower running costs, put parental leave into law, further subsidise childcare and offer pooled, government-backed savings schemes for those in social housing, first-time buyers and those provisioning for their long-term care.

Tom Moore,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"I also believe that States members should be dedicated to their role as Deputy. If the headcount of deputies were ever to be reduced to below 38, you will really notice who is pulling their weight and who isn’t. Voters deserve deputies who treat the role as a serious, full-time commitment. I also believe attendance in committee and assembly meetings needs to be tracked and published in the Guernsey Press and the States’ official digital channels."

Andrew Niles,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,"Housing availability must be a core priority in the new term.

David Nussbaumer,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",1,I am dismayed at the ongoing fiasco such as Leale’s Yard and the ridiculous zoning such as Heritage of the Castel Hospital which should be reversed now.

To support this, I want to give you the choice to use the first 10 years of your secondary pension contributions - matched by your employer - for a deposit to enable you to buy your first house. Owning or renting a house is currently a pipedream for many. The housing crisis is directly related to scarcity of viable land and the availability of skilled labour.

Rob Prow,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",2,Just about everyone agrees there is a housing crisis. The dream for families to own a home is disappearing and rents are becoming unaffordable. We are not building enough houses and government policies are not working. This crisis must first and foremost be viewed through the lens of local residents. States owned land and buildings must come into the equation.

Steve Williams,Transport & Connectivity,"Supports improving transport links — including air/sea travel affordability, reliability, and access.",-1,Connectivity - reliability and cost of the current air connectivity is not working and action needs to be taken to improve the current situation.

Steve Williams,Environment & Sustainability,"Supports environmental protection and climate action — including conservation, energy transition, or sustainable development practices.",1,"Impact of climate change - we need a plan of action on our sea flood defences and water catchment. I would be keen to encourage greater energy independence, including potential wind power and tidal power as well as incentivising solar panels on roofs across the island rather than paying for another cable to France (which increases our dependence on other countries)."
Chris Blin,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",0,"I will press for action on affordable housing. I have worked on practical reforms to make housebuilding easier whilst at the same time ensuring we protect our Island character. We do not have enough homes for the people who live and work here and delays in planning, policy and delivery compound the problem. We must embrace Modern Methods of Construction (MMC) for quicker, cheaper builds. Launch a States-backed Housing Scheme to unlock capital. Reform partial ownership rules to allow full progression to 100% ownership. Increase supply in the affordable, key worker and first-time buyer markets. Support grants and loans for young islanders."

Chris Blin,Economy & Business,"Supports initiatives to stimulate the economy — including small business support, diversification, investment incentives, and economic growth policies.",2,"I want to strengthen and diversify our economy. I bring a business mindset, political experience and a focus on delivery, reform, responsibility and results.

John Dyke,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",1,The States MUST put its enormous land bank to good use. We need affordable housing to buy including partial ownership units built by the GHA.

John Dyke,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",0,"The bright spot on this is our new Institute which will start building soon.

Aidan Matthews,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",0,"Guernsey has a serious housing crisis. It’s always been difficult here, but now it’s worse than it’s ever been. The States has the tools to help islanders but hasn’t worked effectively or together as a unit to get results. Planning needs to allocate areas for development that can go ahead quickly. Brownfield should always come first before losing more of our precious green spaces."

Aidan Matthews,Education,"Supports improving access, quality, or investment in education — including the structure of secondary and post-16 education.",0,"Education issues inspired me to seek election for my first term. All parents want the best for their children, and many share similar concerns about the direction of education. This political term has seen divisions open up in the assembly, and our island feels more divided than ever. Cutting short the education review and pushing through with the worst of all options was a low point of this States. With pupil numbers falling it’s clear that a more considerate approach to education is needed."

Aidan Matthews,Governance & Political Reform,"Supports reforms to how government operates — including transparency, efficiency, States reform, and public engagement.",1,"I want a more open government with greater accountability.

Charles Parkinson,Housing,"Supports building more affordable and accessible housing across the island, including rental and ownership options.",1,"Speaking of our young people, we absolutely have to ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable housing on the island.
